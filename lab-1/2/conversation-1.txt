Hi, I'd like to book a room.
Great, where are you travelling to?
To London.
London is a great choice! And when do you plan to arrive?
Tomorrow.
Tomorrow it is. How long do you want to stay?

So to confirm, you want to stay in London starting from March 3rd to March 5th. Is that correct?
Yes.
Are you staying with someone else?
No.
We have rooms available in the City starting at 200 pounds. Do you prefer economy or business rooms?
Business.
Perfect. Business starts at 350 pounds. Do you have any preferences regarding your room?

Great. Can we offer you a breakfast with your reservation? For you the price is 10 pounds per a breakfast.
Yes, please.
Amazing! It will be 630 pounds for your stay. Would that be all?
